<h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback/?product=Lungo&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1263070803) and click “Version History”.

<a id="lid-closed"></a>
#### Does it work when the lid is closed?

No, that’s not allowed for apps on the App Store, for good reasons. Imagine you activate it while your computer is doing a heavy task and then put the laptop in your bag. Your laptop could easily overheat.

However, if you really want this, there are some solutions [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2389/is-there-any-way-to-set-a-macbook-pro-to-not-sleep-when-you-close-the-lid?rq=1).

#### Does Lungo keep my Mac awake even if there is a scheduled sleep?

If you have set a sleep schedule in “System Preferences › Battery › Schedule”, it will take priority over Lungo. This is out of Lungo's control.

#### Can I left-click the icon to toggle it like with Caffeine?

Yes, choose “Activate on Left-click” in the preferences.

<a id="custom-duration"></a>
#### Can I use a custom duration?

Lungo comes with a set of commonly used durations, which should be enough for most users. People love Lungo for its simplicity. Lungo has tens of thousands of users and only a few people have requested a custom duration. However, power users can take advantage of the Shortcuts app to use custom durations. Drag the the “Set Enabled State” Lungo action into the shortcut editor in the Shortcuts app. Click “Show more” and then choose a custom duration. You can pin the shortcut workflow to the menu bar for easy access or set a global keyboard shortcut for it.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't have any immediate plans to localize the app.

#### How is it different from Amphetamine?

Amphetamine has lots of features. Most of which I would never use. It ships with a myriad of menu bar icons to choose from, but none that looks good. With Lungo, I wanted a focused and simple app with great defaults.

<h3 id="scripting">Scripting</h3>

You can control Lungo using anything that supports opening a URL with a custom scheme.

*Lungo also comes with support for Shortcuts.*

Tip: You can [run shortcuts from the command-line](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts-mac/run-shortcuts-from-the-command-line-apd455c82f02/mac).

#### Integrations

- [lungo-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/lungo-cli) - Command-line tool.
- [Raycast commands](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands/tree/master/commands#lungo)

#### Custom URL scheme

For example, to activate Lungo for 10 minutes, run this terminal command:

```sh
open --background 'lungo:activate?minutes=10'
```

#### Commands

- `activate`
- `deactivate`
- `toggle`

The `activate` and `toggle` commands support the parameters `hours` and `minutes`, which can be used together or individually. If you don't specify a duration, it will use the default duration you have set in Lungo.

#### Examples

##### Shell

```sh
# Deactivate Lungo
open --background 'lungo:deactivate'

# Activate Lungo for 1 hours and 30 minutes
open --background 'lungo:activate?hours=1&minutes=30'

# Activate Lungo for 1 hours and 30 minutes (Alternative)
open --background 'lungo:activate?hours=1.5'

# Toggle Lungo with the default duration
open --background 'lungo:toggle'

# Toggle Lungo for 10 minutes
open --background 'lungo:toggle?minutes=10'
```

##### Node.js

```js
import {execFileSync} from 'node:child_process';

execFileSync('open', ['--background', 'lungo:toggle']);
```

##### Swift

```swift
import Cocoa

let command = "lungo:toggle"

let configuration = NSWorkspace.OpenConfiguration()
configuration.activates = false
NSWorkspace.shared.open(URL(string: command)!, configuration: configuration)
```

##### AppleScript

```applescript
do shell script "open --background 'lungo:toggle'"
```

##### Python

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.run(['open', '--background', 'lungo:toggle'])
```
