Pure Text lets you paste as plain text by default. It sits in the menu bar and clears formatting (fonts, colors, bold, links, tables, etc.) from the text you copy. However, it does not touch unrelated content like files, images, etc. It also ignores content copied from password managers.

You can also choose to manually clear formatting whenever needed instead of automatically.

<h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback/?product=Pure%20Paste&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The app clears formatting when it shouldn't or doesn't clear formatting when it should

[Let me know.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback/?product=Pure%20Paste&referrer=Website-FAQ) I will fix it quickly.

#### Why not just use the `Paste and Match Style` menu item or `⌘⌥⇧V`?

That menu item is not available in all apps. The keyboard shortcut is hard to remember and type. And Pure Paste can exclude certain apps.

#### Why not just remap the `Paste and Match Style` keyboard shortcut to `⌘V`?

That menu item is not available in all apps. Pure Paste can also exclude certain apps.

#### Does it respect [nspasteboard.org](http://nspasteboard.org) conventions?

Yes, it ignores concealed (passwords), transient, and auto-generated content.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making Mac apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1611378436) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't have any immediate plans to localize the app.
