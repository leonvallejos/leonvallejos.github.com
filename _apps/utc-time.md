<h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback/?product=UTC%20Time&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

The date & time output adhere to your locale preferences. I have no plans to localize the app itself.

#### UTC Time doesn't show up in the menu bar

When the menu bar grows too large, macOS hides overflowing items, so UTC Time might have been hidden. Try to close some of your other menu bar apps. There’s, unfortunately, no way for apps to detect this and warn the user.

#### Can you add an analog clock?

No plans to add that.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1538245904) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you add support for other time zones?

That is outside the scope of this app, but check out my app [Dato](https://sindresorhus.com/dato), which does support this.

#### How can I customize the menu bar date and time format?

Same answer as above.

#### Can it show seconds in the clock?

Same answer as above.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making Mac apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.
