#### How can I record system audio?

Recordia doesn't have a built-in way to record system audio because of App Store restrictions. However, you can achieve it by following the below steps:

1. [Install the BlackHole audio driver](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole#installation-instructions)
2. [Set up a multi-output device](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/wiki/Multi-Output-Device)
3. Select “BlackHole” as the input device in Recordia

#### How can I sync recordings to iCloud?

Choose “iCloud Drive” as the output directory.

#### Why 48 kHz and not 44.1 kHz?

48 kHz is the standard for audio in today's video production. It's also the internal production standard for many audio production companies. 44.1 kHz was popularized by music CDs.

#### Why WAV over ALAC/FLAC?

WAV is supported everywhere.

#### Does it do noise reduction?

macOS does some noise reduction by default. For stronger noise reduction, check out [this free app](https://www.utterly.app).

#### Can I use my iPhone as a microphone?

Yes, follow the guide [here](https://www.switchingtomac.com/tutorials/how-to-use-your-iphone-as-a-microphone-on-a-mac/).

#### Where can I find the changelog?
