			For apps with a “Share” menu item, you can trigger one of the share services directly with a global keyboard shortcut. To enable this, go to “System Preferences › Keyboard › Shortcuts › App Shortcuts”, click the plus button, choose “All Applications”, write the name of the share service in the “Menu Title” field (for example, “Save to Downloads”), set the keyboard shortcut, and then click “Add”.

<h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback/?product=Shareful&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### Can you also add a “Move” action?

This is unfortunately not possible. [Share extensions](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/extensions/share-extensions/), like the "Copy" action, only receive a copy of the file. They have no access to the original file.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1522267256) and click “Version History”.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.
